        <h1>Splitting Names</h1>

        <p>
            To help personalise our mailshots we want to have the first name
            and last name of the customer. Unfortunately the customer data
            that we are supplied only contains full names.
        </p>

        <p>
            The system therefore attempts to break a supplied full name into
            its constituents by splitting around whitespace.
        </p>

        <div class="example">

            <h3>Example</h3>

            <p>
                The full name
                <span class="execute" name="result" value="$THIS.split($TEXT)">John Smith</span>
                will be broken into first name
                <span class="eq" value="result.firstName">John</span>
                and last name
                <span class="eq" value="result.lastName">Smith</span>.
            </p>

        </div>
